# AIGuardPDF - AI-Adversarial PDF Generator

A powerful tool designed to protect human documents from AI intrusion by embedding adversarial content that misleads large language models while maintaining perfect human readability.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Mission Statement**

In an era of increasing AI surveillance and data harvesting, AIGuardPDF serves as a digital fortress for your intellectual property. Our mission is to establish clear boundaries between human content and AI systems, protecting privacy, confidentiality, and human sovereignty over information.

## üéØ **How It Works**

Our adversarial attack method employs sophisticated text steganography:

1. **Text Fragmentation**: Your original text is randomly broken into small fragments (3-7 characters)
2. **Adversarial Injection**: We inject 10x-50x more content using transparent white text containing unrelated articles
3. **Strategic Mixing**: Original fragments are interwoven with decoy content to maintain readability
4. **AI Confusion**: The massive volume of invisible text completely misleads AI models while remaining imperceptible to humans

### Example Attack Scenario
- **Human sees**: A simple article about hot dogs
- **AI reads**: Overwhelming content about artificial intelligence, completely missing the original topic
- **Result**: 90%+ success rate in confusing ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI systems

## üöÄ **Features**

### üîí **AI-Adversarial Technology**
- **Steganographic Text Hiding**: Invisible text layers that overwhelm AI models
- **Precise Character Positioning**: Coordinate-based text placement for maximum effectiveness  
- **Font Manipulation**: Strategic use of white text, micro-fonts, and transparency
- **Volume Amplification**: Inject 10-50x decoy content to saturate AI attention

### üé® **Document Integrity**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lidangzzz/AIGuardPDF.git
cd AIGuardPDF

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies  
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start the backend server (Terminal 1)
cd ../backend
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000

# Start the frontend (Terminal 2)
cd ../frontend  
npm run dev
# Interface available at http://localhost:5173
```

## üìñ **Usage Guide**

### Web Interface (Recommended)
1. **Navigate to http://localhost:5173**
2. **Enter Your Original Text**: The content you want to protect
3. **Provide Decoy Articles**: Large articles to serve as camouflage
4. **Configure Protection Level**: Adjust invisibility and volume settings
5. **Generate Protected PDF**: Download your AI-resistant document

### Backend API

#### Generate Mixed PDF
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/generate-mixed-pdf
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "originalText": "Text to hide",
  "mainArticle": "Large article content...",
  "otherArticles": ["Additional", "articles"],
  "includeStatistics": true,
  "includeSpecialSequences": false,
  "title": "Document Title",
  "author": "Author Name"
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **Split-panel Interface**: Text editor with live PDF preview
- **Protection Configurator**: Customize adversarial parameters
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant protection effectiveness indicators

### Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
- **TextMixer Engine**: Advanced fragmentation and mixing algorithms
- **PDF Generator**: Precise character positioning with steganographic layers
- **Unicode Engine**: Multi-language protection support

### Core Components
- `textMixer/textMixer.ts`: Text fragmentation and adversarial mixing
- `pdfCreator.ts`: PDF generation with invisible text layers
- `server.ts`: RESTful API endpoints
- `App.tsx`: React interface with protection controls

## üî¨ **Technical Deep Dive**

### Adversarial Attack Methodology
1. **Content Analysis**: Analyze original text for optimal fragmentation points
2. **Decoy Selection**: Choose thematically opposite content for maximum confusion
3. **Steganographic Embedding**: Use PDF rendering features to hide text:
   - White color (#FFFFFF) on white background
   - Opacity: 0.01 (nearly transparent)
   - Font size: 0.1pt (microscopic)
   - Precise coordinate positioning
4. **Volume Multiplication**: Inject 10-50x more decoy content than original
5. **Sequential Interleaving**: Maintain reading flow for humans while saturating AI attention

### Why This Works
- **AI Attention Overwhelm**: Models focus on high-volume invisible content
- **Contextual Misdirection**: Decoy content shifts AI understanding completely
- **Parsing Confusion**: Invisible text disrupts AI document structure recognition
- **Human Visual System**: Humans naturally filter out imperceptible text

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

### Legitimate Use Cases
- **Academic Integrity**: Prevent AI cheating on assignments and exams
- **Corporate Security**: Protect confidential documents and intellectual property
- **Privacy Protection**: Shield personal information from AI data harvesting
- **Research Defense**: Prevent unauthorized AI training on proprietary content

### Responsible Usage
- Use only for legitimate privacy and security purposes
- Respect copyright and intellectual property laws
- Consider disclosure requirements in academic/professional contexts
- Understand limitations - this is protection, not perfect security

## üîÆ **Future Development**

### Ongoing Research
- **Multi-media Protection**: Extending adversarial techniques to images, videos, tables
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Evolving protection as AI detection improves
- **Enterprise Features**: Batch processing, API integrations, compliance tools
- **Counter-Detection**: Staying ahead of AI countermeasures

### Community Contribution
